#  So why does the casino have a great edge in blackjack?

One of the most popular casino games is blackjack and for good reason—the casino has a very large edge over the player. In fact, the house edge is about 2.5% in standard versions of the game, meaning that for every $100 wagered, the casino keeps an average of $2.50.

There are a few reasons why the casino has such a large edge in blackjack. First, blackjack is a game that can be beaten by counting cards, and the casino knows this. So, they have implemented rules (like limiting players to three decks) that make it more difficult to count cards successfully. Second, in most versions of blackjack, the player has to act before the dealer, which gives the house an advantage. Finally, blackjack is a game where players can lose quickly if they make bad decisions, and casinos love it when players gamble recklessly.

So if you're looking to have some fun at the casino and don't mind losing a little money in the process, blackjack is a great option. But if you're looking to make some money, you're better off playing games with better odds like slots or roulette.

First and foremost, it’s important to understand the basic rules of blackjack. The object of the game is to beat the dealer by getting as close to 21 as possible without going over. You can either hit (take another card) or stand (stick with what you have). If you go over 21, you bust and automatically lose the hand. The dealer must also draw cards until they reach 17 or above, and must stand on all 17s and above.

In addition to following these basic rules, here are a few other tips to keep in mind when playing blackjack at Panathinaikos Casino:

-Never split 10s or 5s. These are two of the worst hands you can have in blackjack, so it’s best not to split them up.

-Try to avoid doubling down on 11 or 12. Again, these are low numbers and not really worth doubling down on.

-When in doubt,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) always hit! Unless you have a very strong hand (17 or above), it’s always better to take another card in order to increase your chances of winning.

#  Blackjack tips and tricks from the pros at Panathinaikos Casino!

**When playing blackjack, it is important to be familiar with the basic rules and strategies in order to improve your chances of winning. Below are some tips and tricks from the pros at Panathinaikos Casino that will help you play like a pro!

1. Always remember to split Aces and Eights. When you are dealt two cards of the same rank, you can split them into two separate hands. This increases your chances of winning since you now have two hands that can potentially receive a good card.

2. In general, always hit on a total of under 17 and stand on totals of 17 or over. This strategy helps you avoid taking unnecessary risks while still having a chance to win the hand.

3. If the dealer has an Ace up, beware! This is a good opportunity to take insurance in case the next card is a 10 (since this will give the dealer blackjack).

4. Be aware of potential bonus opportunities at the casino. Many casinos offer bonus rounds where players can earn extra points or cash prizes. Make sure to read the terms and conditions carefully in order to make sure you are eligible for any bonuses.

5. Practice makes perfect! Whether you are new to blackjack or a seasoned pro, it is always advisable to practice your game before hitting the casino floor. This will help sharpen your skills and give you a better chance of winning big bucks!
