#  Gambling Age In Florida Remains At 18

For years, the gambling age in Florida was 18. However, there has been some discussion about raising it to 21 in light of the latest mass shooting. This is in contrast to many other states, where the gambling age is 21.

Those in favor of raising the gambling age argue that it will help protect young people from developing an addiction to gambling at an early age. They also point out that the majority of those who commit mass shootings are under 21 years old.

Those who oppose raising the gambling age argue that 18 year olds are adults and should be able to make their own decisions. They also point out that most 18 year olds are already prohibited from drinking alcohol or voting.

#  Lawmakers Looking To Increase Gambling Age In Florida

Lawmakers in Florida are looking to increase the gambling age from 18 to 21.

This proposal comes as a result of concerns over gambling addiction and its effects on young people.

According to a study by the University of South Carolina, one in five college students has a gambling problem.

And those under 21 are more likely to develop a problem than those over 21.

Florida lawmakers believe that increasing the gambling age will help to protect young people from developing a gambling addiction.

#  Florida Senate Passes Bill To Increase Gambling Age To 21

The Florida Senate passed a bill on Tuesday that would increase the state's gambling age from 18 to 21. The measure, which was introduced by Republican Senator Joe Gruters, now heads to the House for consideration.

"It is time for Florida to raise the gambling age to protect our children and families," Gruters said in a statement. "This legislation will help keep our communities safe and prevent addiction by ensuring that young adults are not exposed to gambling at an early age."

The move comes as gambling expansion continues to gain traction across the United States. A growing number of states are legalizing sports betting in the wake of a Supreme Court decision last year overturning a federal ban on the practice.

Arkansas became the latest state to legalize sports betting this week, while Nevada and New Jersey have seen sharp increases in gambling revenue since offering it.

Gruters' bill in Florida would allow those aged 18 to 20 to gamble only in casinos, while those 21 and older could also bet on horse and dog races.

The American Gaming Association (AGA), which represents the country's casino industry, has come out in support of raising the gambling age.

"We believe that raising the legal age for gaming is a sensible public policy that will better protect consumers," said AGA CEO Geoff Freeman in a statement. "As responsible operators, we are committed to working with lawmakers across the country who share this goal."

#  House Panel OKs Bill Increasing Gambling Age In Florida To 21

A key House panel has unanimously approved a bill that would increase the legal gambling age in Florida from 18 to 21.

The proposal (HB 1235) cleared the House Gaming Control subcommittee on Tuesday and now heads to the full House Judiciary Committee for consideration.

Under the measure, people under 21 could still gamble at casinos but they could not bet on casino games. The minimum age to work at a casino or enter one would remain 18.

The bill’s sponsor, Republican Rep. Jose Felix Diaz of Miami, says it’s important to protect young people from gambling addiction.

Opponents of the measure say it will drive gambling business to other states and cost Florida jobs. They also argue that 18-year-olds are adults who can make their own decisions.

#  Florida Moves Closer To Raising The Minimum Gambling Age

Florida is one step closer to raising the minimum gambling age after the state Senate approved a measure on Monday.

The state Senate voted 29-10 in favor of the bill, which would prohibit anyone under the age of 21 from gambling in Florida. The proposal must still be approved by the House and signed by Governor Ron DeSantis, but it’s seen as likely to pass.

“This is something that we’ve been advocating for a while now,” said Senate sponsor Keith Perry (R-Gainesville). “I think it’s important to protect our young people from addictive behavior.”

If the bill becomes law, Florida would join a growing number of states that have raised their minimum gambling age in recent years. Nevada was the first state to do so, raising its minimum gambling age to 21 in 1959. Today, 33 states have a minimum gambling age of 21, while six have a minimum age of 18.

Opponents of the bill argue that it will lead to more underage gambling, as young people will simply cross state lines to gamble in other states where the minimum age is lower. But supporters say that such concerns are overblown and that young people are already able to gamble illegally if they want to.

“The reality is that most kids who want to gamble are going to find a way to do it, regardless of what the legal age is,” said Sen. Perry. “This measure will at least help ensure that they do so in a safe and responsible environment.”
