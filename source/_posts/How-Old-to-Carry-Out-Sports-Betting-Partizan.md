#  How Old to Carry Out Sports Betting Partizan

Every country has different laws regulating how old you must be in order to engage in various activities. The same is true for sports betting, which is why it's important to familiarize yourself with the legal age to gamble before placing any bets.

In the United States, you must be at least 18 years old in order to place a sports bet. However, some states allow for people as young as 17 to gamble on horse racing. Nevada and Delaware are the only states that allow people 21 and over to place bets on sports games.

Interestingly, there is no legal age requirement in the United Kingdom for gambling on sports. However, operators do have a responsibility to ensure that customers are aware of the risks involved in gambling and that they are not suffering from any gambling-related problems.

Elsewhere in Europe, there are a range of different laws regulating how old you must be to gamble on sports. In France and Italy, you must be 18 years old, while in Denmark and Sweden the minimum age is just 16. In Germany and Spain, you can start gambling at the age of 18, but must be 21 if you want to participate in betting on horse racing.

It's important to remember that each country has its own unique set of laws governing gambling, so it's always best to consult an attorney or your local gaming authority if you're unsure about the legal age requirements in your area.

#  Sanctions imposed on Partizan for sports betting offenses

The football club Partizan has recently been sanctioned with a 2-year ban from UEFA competitions for offenses related to sports betting. This comes as part of a wider crackdown on match-fixing and betting-related corruption in European football.

Partizan is one of many clubs to be sanctioned by UEFA in recent years. In 2013, Croatian club Dinamo Zagreb were banned for 6 months for their involvement in a betting scandal, and in 2016, two German clubs, Dynamo Dresden and RB Leipzig, were both hit with 1-year bans for similar offenses.

So far, the sanctions imposed by UEFA have had a positive impact on the fight against match-fixing and betting-related corruption. In 2017, UEFA's chief investigator said that "the level of match manipulation has decreased in Europe" as a result of the introduction of new rules and punishments. However, it remains to be seen whether these sanctions will be enough to completely eradicate these problems from European football.

#  Serbia's Partizan sanctioned for underage gambling in soccer

Serbia’s football powerhouse Partizan has been sanctioned by the country’s soccer governing body for promoting illegal gambling among minors, Reuters reports.

Partizan, who have won the Serbian title a record 34 times, will be unable to sign any new players until the end of the season and also fined 150,000 euros.

According to Reuters, the club has been punished for "the illegal promotion of gambling among minors" which was discovered during an initiative targeting clubs in Serbia's top flight.

Officials from Sportradar, a specialist provider of sports data and intelligence services, alerted authorities after identifying suspicious betting patterns around a match involving Partizan's youth side in March 2017.

Gambling is illegal under Serbian law for those under 18 years of age.

Partizan said they will appeal the sanction.

#  NBA director: There's no age limit for betting on sports

There is no minimum age for betting on sports, NBA director said in an interview with ESPN.

Rothenberg, the NBA’s executive vice president of legal and business affairs, was asked about the age limit for wagering on sporting events and replied, "There is no minimum age."

The comments come as the U.S. Supreme Court weighs a case that could result in states being able to legalize gambling on sports.

"We have not taken a position on that," Rothenberg said of the potential legalization of gambling on sports. "We're watching what's happening in the courts and we'll make decisions as to what our appropriate posture is going to be."

NBA commissioner Adam Silver has been a vocal advocate for legalized sports gambling. In a New York Times op-ed piece in 2014, Silver wrote that he believes "a federal framework legalizing betting across states is preferable to a state-by-state approach."

"I think permitting betting on sports will increase fan engagement with our games," Silver wrote. "It will create more opportunities for fans to interact with our athletes, team personnel and officials."
