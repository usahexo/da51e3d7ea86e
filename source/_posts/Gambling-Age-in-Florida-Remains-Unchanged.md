#  Gambling Age in Florida Remains Unchanged

In spite of numerous requests to change the gambling age in Florida, the state’s lawmakers have not budged on the issue. For years, there have been petitions and pleas from parents and young adults alike to increase or even abolish the gambling age in Florida, but all efforts have fallen on deaf ears.

Many Floridians feel that the gambling age should be raised to 21, as is the case in most other states. They argue that underage gambling can lead to addiction and other harmful behaviors, and that it is unfair for kids to be able to gamble when they are not old enough to drink or vote.

Others believe that the current gambling age should be lowered to 18, because young people are already allowed to do many things at that age (such as drive, get married, and serve in the military). They say that if someone is old enough to make responsible decisions about those things, they should be allowed to gamble as well.

So far, however, state legislators have not been swayed by either argument. The current gambling age in Florida remains at 18.

#  Florida Senate Passes Bill to Increase Gambling Age to 21

The Florida Senate has unanimously passed a bill that will increase the gambling age from 18 to 21.

Republican Senator Bill Galvano, who sponsored the bill, said that it would help protect young people from gambling addiction.

“It is my hope that by increasing the minimum age to gamble at casinos and bet on horse races, we can help protect our young people from developing a gambling addiction and risking their hard-earned money,” he said.

The bill will now go before the Florida House of Representatives for approval.

#  Lawmakers Disagree on Gambling Age in Florida

A gambling age is a law that sets the minimum legal age at which an individual is allowed to gamble. This age varies by jurisdiction, typically ranging from 18 to 21 years old. In the United States, gambling is regulated on the state level, meaning that lawmakers within each state decide on their own gambling age.

As a result, there is significant variation among states when it comes to gambling ages. In some states, such as Nevada and New Jersey, the minimum gambling age is 18 years old. In others, such as Mississippi and Louisiana, the minimum age is 21 years old.

The debate over gambling ages in America often focuses on two key questions: Is there a right age for gambling? And should the government be responsible for protecting people from their own choices?

Proponents of increasing the gambling age argue that young adults are not sufficiently developed cognitively and emotionally to make informed decisions about whether to gamble or not. They say that adolescents and young adults are more likely to become addicted to gambling and experience negative consequences, such as financial instability or mental health problems.

Opponents of increasing the gambling age counter that prohibiting adults from engaging in legal activities does not always achieve desired outcomes. For example, raising the drinking age has not prevented young people from consuming alcohol; it has simply pushed this behavior underground, leading to increased rates of DUIs and other health problems. They argue that if adults are able to make informed decisions about other potentially harmful activities such as driving or drinking alcohol, they should also be able to make informed decisions about gambling.

#  Minimum Gambling Age in Florida to Remain at 18

Florida lawmakers have decided that the state's minimum gambling age of 18 will remain unchanged for now.

The Florida House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly against a bill on Tuesday that would have raised the minimum age to 21. The vote was 107-10 against the bill.

State Rep. Michael Caruso, a sponsor of the bill, said that he was "disappointed" in the House's decision. He added that he believes the state's minimum gambling age is too low and puts minors at risk for addiction.

Opponents of the bill argued that it would drive gambling activity underground and make it more difficult for law enforcement to monitor. They also said that most gambling activities are already illegal for those under 21 anyway.

The current minimum gambling age in Florida has been in place since 1978.

#  What is the Gambling Age in Florida?

The legal gambling age in Florida is 21. This applies to all types of gambling, including casino games, lottery tickets, and bingo.

It’s important to remember that the legal gambling age is just that – the legal age at which you are allowed to gamble. It’s not illegal for someone under 21 to gamble, as long as they are doing so in a state where it is legal. Gambling is a popular activity among young people, and many teenagers and college students will participate in activities like online poker or sports betting.

While it’s not technically illegal for someone under 21 to gamble, there can be consequences if they are caught. For example, if you are caught gambling in a casino when you are under 21, the casino can confiscate your winnings and may also ban you from the premises. If you are caught gambling online, your internet service provider could suspend your account.

So, what happens if you break the law and gamble when you are underage? The consequences vary depending on the situation, but could include a fine, jail time, or both. It’s important to remember that breaking the law can have serious consequences, so be sure to check the legal age for gambling in your state before you start playing any games!
