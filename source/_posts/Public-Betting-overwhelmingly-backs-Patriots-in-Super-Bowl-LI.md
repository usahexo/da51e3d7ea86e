#  Public Betting overwhelmingly backs Patriots in Super Bowl LI

The New England Patriots are currently 3-point underdogs in their Super Bowl LI matchup against the Atlanta Falcons. However, according to most public betting trends and Prop Bets available, the Pats are still expected to win the game.

At William Hill sports books, 63 percent of tickets have been placed on the Patriots, while 72 percent of money wagered has come in on New England. That’s a far cry from when these two teams met during the regular season – only 25 percent of tickets were on the Pats in that game, with 54 percent of dollars wagered on Atlanta.

Meanwhile, at Westgate SuperBook in Las Vegas, 83 percent of tickets are backing the Patriots. And prop bets seem to be overwhelmingly in favor of New England as well. Tom Brady is currently 2/3 to win MVP honors for the game, and 5/6 to win the game outright. The Falcons are available at 7/4 to win outright and 4/1 to win by three points or less.

So what does all this mean? It seems that despite being underdogs on paper, the odds are still in favor of New England taking home their fifth Lombardi Trophy this Sunday night.

#  Record amounts wagered on Super Bowl at 888Sport

888Sport, a leading provider of sports betting services, released data indicating that the amount wagered on this year’s Super Bowl was significantly higher than in previous years.

The total amount wagered on the game reached over $138 million, making it the most bet-on Super Bowl in history. This represents a 34% increase from the amount wagered in 2017.

This surge in betting activity is likely attributable to the close match-up between the New England Patriots and the Los Angeles Rams, which resulted in a dramatic finish.

The Rams were initially deemed underdogs, but their upset victory over Tom Brady and the Patriots has made them one of the most popular bets of all time.

In addition to record amounts being wagered on the game itself, there was also unprecedented interest in Prop bets – or bets on specific aspects of the game.

Some of the more popular Prop bets included whether or not there would be a touchdown scored in the first 10 minutes of play, and whether or not either team would score a field goal in the first half.

888Sport is expecting even more action leading up to next year’s Super Bowl, as Americans continue to embrace sports betting as an enjoyable way to add excitement to major sporting events.

#  Patriots and Falcons see nearly even action in pre-game betting

The New England Patriots and the Atlanta Falcons are both considered strong football teams, but in pre-game betting, the Patriots barely hold the advantage.

According to Oddschecker, a site that aggregates bets from around the web, the Patriots are currently favored by 2.5 points. This means that if you bet on New England to win, they would have to win by more than two points for you to make a profit.

The Falcons are currently receiving about 43 percent of bets, so there is still some money to be made if you think they can pull off an upset.

This game is sure to be close, and it could come down to the last minute. Be sure to tune in and see who comes out on top!

#  Bettors flock to high-profile options for NCAA Tournament

The NCAA Men’s Basketball Tournament is one of the most popular sporting events in the United States, and bettors are keen to take advantage of the large number of games and betting options. Bettors can choose from a range of bets, including point spread bets, money line bets, and over/under bets.

In the early rounds of the tournament, many bettors focus on high-profile matchups between Power Five conference teams. However, there are also a number of opportunities to make money by betting on lower-profile games. In fact, some of the most profitable bets in the tournament are on games between teams from smaller conferences.

One example is the game between Murray State and Florida State on Thursday. Murray State is a 14-point underdog according to the point spread, but they have proved to be a formidable opponent this season. The Racers have won 20 games this season and they nearly upset Villanova in their last game. Florida State is not a bad team, but they are certainly not as good as Villanova. The Racers could pull off an upset in this game and provide bettors with a lucrative return on investment.

There are also opportunities to make money by betting on teams from lower-profile conferences in later rounds of the tournament. For example, Loyola-Chicago is a small school from Illinois that is considered to be a long shot to win the tournament. However, they have already pulled off two upsets and they could very well make it all the way to the championship game. Betting on Loyola-Chicago provides an excellent opportunity for bettors to make some money if they are willing to risk a little bit more on their bets.

#  More than $400,000 wagered on Golden State Warriors in first four games of NBA playoffs

The Golden State Warriors were heavily favored to win the NBA championship at the start of the playoffs, and the betting public has backed that up.

More than $400,000 has been wagered on Golden State to win the title at William Hill sports books in Nevada, according to ESPN. The Warriors are currently 4-0 against the spread in the playoffs.

The second-most wagered-on team is the Cleveland Cavaliers, who have attracted just over $100,000 worth of tickets. The Cavs are 2-2 against the spread thus far in the playoffs.

"The odds reflect where people have put their money," William Hill sports book director Nick Bogdanovich told ESPN. "Golden State is a very popular team."
