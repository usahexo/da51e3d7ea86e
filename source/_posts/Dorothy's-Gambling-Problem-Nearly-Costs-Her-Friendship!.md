#  Dorothy's Gambling Problem Nearly Costs Her Friendship!

Dorothy had always been a bit of a gambler. She loved the thrill of betting on games and seeing if she could outsmart the odds. But lately, her gambling had started causing problems with her friends.

One evening, Dorothy went out for drinks with her buddies after work. She had a few too many cocktails and decided to bet them all on a game of pool. Dorothy was feeling confident and sure of herself-- she was going to win big! She lost badly, and was so drunk that she couldn't even remember what happened the next day.

The next time Dorothy met up with her friends, they were noticeably cold towards her. It slowly dawned on Dorothy that she may have lost them as friends because of her gambling problem. This realization was painful, but it also motivated Dorothy to get help for her addiction.

If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling problem, seek professional help as soon as possible. Gambling can be incredibly addictive, and can ruin your relationships with friends and family members. There is no shame in seeking help- in fact, it takes courage and strength to admit that you need assistance.
