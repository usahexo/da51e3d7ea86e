# Blackjack Online: What is His Skin Graft?

If you have ever played blackjack online, you may have come across the term "his skin graft" or "skin graft" in reference to the dealer's up card. This term can be confusing for those who are new to the game, but it is simply a code used by some online casinos to identify the dealer's up card.

In blackjack, the dealer's up card is the face-up card that is visible to all players at the table. This card plays a significant role in determining the outcome of the game, as players must use this information to make strategic decisions about their own hands.

The "skin graft" term is used as a code for the different ranks of the dealer's up card. Each rank is given a specific skin graft designation to make it easier for players to identify and remember:

- Ace: "his skin graft" or simply "skin graft"
- King: "the bandage"
- Queen: "the patch"
- Jack: "the thimble"
- Ten: "the dime"
- Nine: "the nickel"
- Eight: "the razor"
- Seven: "the needle"
- Six: "the cork"
- Five: "the shoe"
- Four: "the sail"
- Three: "the toothpick"
- Two: "the deuce"

These designations are not universal across all online casinos, so it is important to check the specific rules of the casino you are playing at to understand what term they use for each rank of the dealer's up card.

Knowing the skin graft designations can be helpful in making strategic decisions when playing blackjack online. For example, if the dealer's up card is an ace (i.e., "skin graft"), it is important to remember that there is a high probability that the dealer will have a 10-value card in the hole (i.e., face-down). This knowledge can help players make informed decisions about whether to hit or stand on their own hands.

In conclusion, "his skin graft" or "skin graft" is a term used in some online casinos to designate the dealer's up card in blackjack. Knowing the skin graft designations can help players make more informed decisions when playing the game.
