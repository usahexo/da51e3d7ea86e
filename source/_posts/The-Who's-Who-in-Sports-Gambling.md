#  The Who's Who in Sports Gambling

The world of sports gambling is a complicated and ever-changing one. Just as with any other form of gambling, there are always new faces popping up in the sports book scene, while others seem to disappear without warning. So who's who in the world of sports gambling?

There are a few names that immediately come to mind. The first is Tony Kornheiser, former sportswriter for the Washington Post and current commentator for ESPN's "Pardon the Interruption". Kornheiser has been involved in sports gambling for years, and is generally considered an authority on the subject.

Then there's Jimmy Vaccaro, who has been working in Las Vegas sports books since the 1970s. Vaccaro is known for being one of the first people to take bets on NFL games over the phone, and is also credited with coming up with the term "point spread".

And finally, there's Bill Polian, former GM of both the Indianapolis Colts and Carolina Panthers football teams. Polian is considered something of a celebrity in the world of sports betting, thanks to his extensive knowledge of NFL odds and betting trends.

While those three individuals are certainly some of the most well-known faces in sports gambling, they're by no means the only ones worth knowing about. In fact, there are literally hundreds (if not thousands) of people involved in sports betting on a daily basis - from professional gamblers to oddsmakers to bookmakers to bettors themselves. It's a complex web, but it's one that's constantly evolving - making it more important than ever to stay on top of all the latest news and developments.
